# 2d-pose-caren.pytorch

Pytorch code for human pose estimation, especially for CAREN dataset.

## What's CAREN
The Computer Assisted Rehabilitation ENvironment (CAREN) is a versatile, multi sensory system for clinical analysis, rehabilitation, evaluation and registration of the human balance system. The use of virtual reality enables researchers to assess the subjectâ€™s behavior and includes sensory inputs like visual, auditory, vestibular and tactile.[see more.](https://www.motekforcelink.com/product/caren/)

## CAREN Data
- video
  - videos captured the movement of subject(usually patients) from three different angles, 50fps.
- csv
  - contains 3d location information of 21 markers attached to the subject's joints, per 0.01 second.
- c3d
  - contains original 3d location information of markers and some annotations about the information of platform and camera.
- report.pdf
  - the report document.

## Support Networks:

- DeepPose
- PoseAttention
- PoseRes
- PyraNet
- StackedHourGlass

## Datasets

CAREN Dataset

## Requirements

- pytorch
- torchvision
- tensorboard

## Traing

1. edit `pathgen.py` in dataset folder, change data_path to "/your/data/path/" and run `python dataset/pathgen.py`

2. run `tensorboard --logdir=runs` in terminal, open `tensorboard` for training visualization.

3. run `python train.py` start traing. 

## Test

1. `params.ckpt = './models/ckpt_epoch_100.pth'` 

2. `python test.py`
